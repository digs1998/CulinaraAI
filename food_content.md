[Jayme O.](https://www.food.com/user/2002985099) reviewed [Strawberry Buckle](https://www.food.com/recipe/strawberry-buckle-122304 "Strawberry  Buckle")
I have been searching for THE strawberry coffee cake or loaf. This is it!! FYI 1 pound box of strawberries is equivalent to 2 cups of diced. Thanks Bri! FYI Buckle history...1840s when baking soda became a commercially available leavening agent and ovens in homes became popular. &quot;Buckle&quot; is because the fresh fruit made the top of the cake buckle.
