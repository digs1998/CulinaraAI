Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork in single layer (if needed, wait for some pieces to render fat and shrink before adding remainder) and cook until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping pieces halfway through cooking.",

Add milk and shortening and continue to mix until no dry flour remains and dough has formed ball around hook, about 2 minutes longer. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 minutes.",

Off heat, remove steamer from wok and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer buns, still on parchment, to wire rack. Steam remaining buns.",

      "STORAGE AND REHEATING: Bao can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 3 hours or refrigerated for up to 3 days. To serve, resteam (on parchment squares) for 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, bao can be frozen for up to 1 month. Arrange cooled bao (on parchment squares) in zipper-lock bag.

Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult an expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman."
