    "description": "After weeks of testing the waters, we realized there\u2019s a better way to poach shrimp. Then we upgraded the \u201ccocktail\u201d with fresh takes on the dipping sauce. Shrimp cocktail should feel like luxury: plump, snappy, well-chilled meat with clean, oceanic sweetness. Nailing that profile is all about poaching the shrimp just right. Brining the shrimp seasoned them deeply, evenly, and quickly. Poaching them in the brine along with additional lightly seasoned water enhanced their flavor even more. Heating a measured amount of shrimp and water together allowed the shrimp to cook gradually so that there was little risk of overshooting the mark of 140 degrees. Calibrating the recipe so that the shrimp reached 140 degrees when the water reached 160 allowed us to monitor the temperature of the water instead of the temperature of the shrimp. For some fresh takes on the dipping sauce, we riffed on classic cocktail sauce and also mixed up a Creole R\u00e9moulade and Creamy Chermoula.",

Stir in reserved dashima broth, \u00bc teaspoon sugar, \u00bc teaspoon seasoning salt, and \u00bc teaspoon Dasida powder; cover; and cook on standard rice setting according to manufacturer's directions. Machine will automatically shut off when cooking is completed (typically indicated by \u201cKeep Warm\u201d light turning on). Using moistened rice paddle or silicone spatula, gently fluff rice (this ensures even texture and moisture distribution). Cover and set aside.FOR THE STOVETOP: Transfer rice to large saucepan. Stir in reserved dashima broth, \u00bc teaspoon sugar, \u00bc teaspoon seasoning salt, and \u00bc teaspoon Dasida powder. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low (medium if using electric stove), cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is fully absorbed, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit for 15 minutes to finish cooking. Using moistened rice paddle or silicone spatula, gently fluff rice. Cover and set aside.",

Using tongs, quickly transfer spinach to large bowl of cold water and run hands gently through spinach to cool it down. Drain spinach and repeat covering with cold water until spinach has completely cooled. Working in batches, squeeze spinach by hand to remove excess water.

Squeeze spinach by hand to remove excess water that has accumulated. Add remaining \u00bc teaspoon sugar, remaining \u215b teaspoon seasoning salt, remaining \u00bc teaspoon Dasida powder, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and sesame seeds to spinach. Lift and loosen individual pieces of spinach and mix gently until evenly coated with seasonings. Cut omelet lengthwise into quarters.",

Using lightly moistened hands, scoop one-quarter of seasoned rice, place rice on gim, and spread it out evenly all the way to edges. (Parts of gim should still be visible through rice; rice should not form solid layer.) Starting 1 inch from bottom edge of gim, use one-quarter of danmuji, one-quarter of carrot, and one-quarter of spinach to create three thin, adjacent rows. Use one-quarter of avocado slices and one-quarter of fish cakes to create two rows on top, followed by row of crab and row of omelet on top of avocado and fish cakes, overlapping ends if needed.",
      "Using bamboo mat as guide, lift and roll bottom edge of gim sheet up and over filling. Gently squeeze to tighten roll. Lift up top edge of mat and continue to roll remaining gim and rice into log, using mat to gently squeeze roll to seal and tighten it as you go. When fully rolled, flip bamboo mat over and roll mat away from you to release gimbap. Set gimbap aside, seam side down, and repeat shaping 3 more gimbap using remaining gim sheets, rice, and filling.",
      "Brush gimbap with remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Using sharp knife, cut each roll into \u00bd-inch-thick slices, dipping knife in water between cuts if slices begin to stick. Sprinkle with extra sesame seeds and serve."

            "text": "After croissants have been rising for 2 hours, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 425 degrees. In small bowl, whisk together egg, water, and pinch salt. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place croissants in oven and reduce temperature to 400 degrees. Bake for 12 minutes, then switch and rotate baking sheets. Continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer to wire rack and cool about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
