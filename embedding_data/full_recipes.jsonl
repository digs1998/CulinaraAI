Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using.

It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1/2 of the sauce from this \r\nrecipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later!  Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review.  I read and appreciate every one of them!  Chef Note:  After I posted this recipe I remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss.

I thought the oven temp of 275 sounded a little low, but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. I do not know if the little \"freezer trick\" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but I did it, and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. Would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and I got exceptional results. So moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o)  Depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it.  I was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over again!!

From an article in my local newspaper\n\nCategory: Dessert\n\nPreparation time: 15 minutes\n\nCooking time: Not specified\n\nTotal time: 15 minutes\n\nServings: 2 crusts\n\nIngredients:\n- 3 cups flour\n- 1 cup shortening\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2-2/3 cup very cold water\n\nInstructions:\n1. Cut shortening into flour/salt until it looks like peas.\n2. Add very cold water all at once and quickly toss with a fork; shape into a ball being careful not to over knead.\n3. Divide dough in half and roll thin.\n4. This makes two single piecrusts or one double crust pie.\n5. TIPS AND TRICKS:.\n6. To avoid a soggy crust, try brushing the bottom of the crust with egg white before adding fruit; filling the shell *just* before baking also helps prevent sogginess; sogginess can also be caused from the oven temperature being too low or the time too short.\n7. For a flakier upper crust, brush lightly with cold water before popping in the oven; also keep ingredients and dough cold until baked.\n8. To prevent the crust from shrinking, avoid stretching the dough as you roll it and avoid stretching it when placed in the pie plate; allowing the pie shell to rest about 30 minutes before baking will also help prevent shrinking.\n9. Never shake the flour while placing in the measuring cup; instead, level it with the back of a knife.\n10. Toss ingredients with a fork, lightly and quickly, rather than stirring.\n11. Don't use too much water; about 1/2 c of iced water to 2 cups of flour.\n12. To prevent burning of the crust, try baking the pie in a large paper bag stapled closed, being sure that it doesn't touch any part of the oven; or use an oven- roasting bag.\n13. Try rolling some grated cheese into the dough when making an apple pie.\n14. Try adding toasted slivered almonds to piecrust that you intend to fill with a cream filling or cherry filling.", "metadata": {"title": "Basic Pie &amp; Pastry Crust + Tips &amp; Tricks", "category": "Dessert", "cuisine": null, "prep_time": "15 minutes", "cook_time": "Not specified", "total_time": "15 minutes", "servings": "2 crusts", "calories": "1588.6", "rating": 5.0, "review_count": 11, "ingredient_count": 4, "step_count": 14, "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/basic-pie-pastry-crust-tips-tricks-148258"}}

When the cheese is melted, slowly whisk in the cream. Add dry fenugreek leaves, garam masala and salt to taste. Put in the chicken pieces and stir for 3-4 minutes over medium heat.\n7.

Sauce can be made in a advance to be reheated at the time that eggs are done. In this recipe, I've reduced the amount of oil used to make it low fat, but you can use more if you need to.\n\nCategory: Breakfast\n\nPreparation time: 15 minutes\n\nCooking time: 1 hour\n\nTotal time: 1 hour 15 minutes\n\nServings: 6 serving(s)\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 teaspoons olive oil\n- 4 extra large ripe tomatoes, chopped\n- 2 red bell peppers, diced\n- 1 large onion, diced\n- 1 green jalapeno pepper, finely diced\n- 26 1/2 ounces pomi brand chopped tomatoes (nothing works like this!)\n- kosher salt, to taste\n- black pepper, to taste\n- 6 large eggs (or as many as will fit on your saut\u00c3\u0192 pan)\n\nInstructions:\n1. You need a large nonstick deep saut pan that has a cover. Saut onions in olive oil until opaque and tender.\n2. Add red bell pepper and continue sauteeing until it softens up.\n3. Reduce heat to low. Add the fresh chopped tomatoes, cook until they are breaking apart.\n4. With a slotted spoon, add the chunkiest parts of the contents of the \"Pomi\" - the majority of the sauce should remain in the carton. Add the jalapeno now also.\n5. Cook for 30-40 minutes, partially cover, and stir every once in a while. If it starts to look dry, add some of the sauce from the carton, slowly , as you need it. Add the salt and pepper - I like a lot because I love salt on tomatoes.\n6. The final product should be a thick sauce that just looks like a whole lot of tomatoes stuck together - with very little to no juice, that is about 1-1 1/2 inches high.\n7. Crack open the eggs on top of the shakshuka, one by one, giving each their own space. The whites should overlap, but the yolk should be spaced about 4 fingerwidths from each other. My pan can fit 6-8 eggs very comfortably.\n8. Cover tightly with a lid and simmer for 20 minutes.", "metadata": {"title": "Israeli Shakshuka", "category": "Breakfast", "cuisine": null, "prep_time": "15 minutes", "cook_time": "1 hour", "total_time": "1 hour 15 minutes", "servings": "6 serving(s)", "calories": "145", "rating": 5.0, "review_count": 4, "ingredient_count": 9, "step_count": 8, "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/israeli-shakshuka-281877"}}
