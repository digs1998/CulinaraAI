Melt the butter in a casserole dish over a low heat. Add the leek, chicken, herbs and seasoning, and cook for 10-12 mins until the chicken is cooked, the leeks have softened, and the mixture is simmering. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 mins until the mix resembles a sandy paste. Pour in the wine or sherry, and bubble for 1 min, then stir in the stock, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or cream and the mustard. Bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 mins until the chicken is cooked through. Season to taste, remove from the heat and leave to cool completely. Tip into a container and chill for 2 hrs, or overnight. Will keep chilled for up to two days.\n2. To make the pastry, rub the butter into the flour with a large pinch of salt until completely combined. Add half the beaten egg and 4 tbsp ice-cold water, and bring together into a dough using your hands, adding a little more water if needed. Knead for a minute so it completely comes together, then chill for 1 hr.\n3. Butter a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin. Roll two-thirds of the pastry out until large enough to line the tin with some overhanging. Use it to line the tin, then spoon in the filling. Roll out the remaining pastry until large enough to cover the pie. Brush the edge of the pastry with a little of the remaining beaten egg, then drape over the pie to close it. Trim the edge, then press with a fork to seal. Chill until you\u2019re ready to cook. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.\n4. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a baking sheet inside. Brush the pie with some of the remaining beaten egg, then lightly score a criss-cross pattern on top using a sharp knife. Bake on the hot sheet for 20 mins, then brush with the rest of the egg, season with sea salt flakes and bake for 15-20 mins more until deep golden. Remove from the oven and rest for 10 mins, then carefully remove from the tin, put on a board and cut into wedges to serve.\n\nCategory: Dinner", "metadata": {"title": "Next level chicken pie", "category": "Dinner", "ingredient_count": 13, "step_count": 4, "url": "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/next-level-chicken-pie"}}

Reduce heat to low (medium if using electric stove), cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is fully absorbed, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit for 15 minutes to finish cooking. Using moistened rice paddle or silicone spatula, gently fluff rice. Cover and set aside.\n4. Meanwhile, bring 1 quart water and salt to boil in large saucepan. Add spinach and submerge completely. Blanch until spinach is bright green but still has some bite, about 10 seconds. Using tongs, quickly transfer spinach to large bowl of cold water and run hands gently through spinach to cool it down. Drain spinach and repeat covering with cold water until spinach has completely cooled. Working in batches, squeeze spinach by hand to remove excess water. Untangle spinach and transfer it to medium bowl; set aside.\n5. Beat eggs, \u215b teaspoon sugar, \u215b teaspoon seasoning salt, and \u215b teaspoon Dasida powder in separate bowl until eggs are thoroughly combined and mixture is pure yellow. Heat 1 teaspoon neutral oil in 8\u00bd by 7\u00bd-inch rectangular nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add egg mixture, tilting and shaking skillet gently until egg evenly covers bottom of pan. Cook, undisturbed, until bottom of omelet is just set but top is still slightly wet, 1 to 3 minutes.\n6. Using two thin spatulas, gently lift one-third of omelet (one of long sides) over, then fold omelet in half. Continue to cook, gently flipping and turning omelet, until lightly set, about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and let eggs continue to cook using residual heat until fully set, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer omelet to cutting board and let it rest while continuing to prepare filling.\n7. Heat 4 teaspoons neutral oil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add carrot and cook, tossing constantly, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in \u00bc teaspoon sugar and \u00bc teaspoon seasoning salt until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer carrot to plate and set aside.\n8. Place fish cake strips in strainer and thoroughly rinse under hot water. Drain strips well and pat dry with paper towels. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil in now-empty wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add fish cakes and cook, tossing constantly, until evenly coated in oil, about 15 seconds. Add soy sauce and 1\u00bd teaspoons sugar and mix until just combined, about 20 seconds (don't overcook or else fish cakes will become hard and chewy). Transfer fish cakes to separate plate.\n9. Just before you are ready to assemble gimbap, transfer rice to large bowl, add sushi seasoning and 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and gently fluff with rice paddle or silicone spatula until well combined. Squeeze spinach by hand to remove excess water that has accumulated. Add remaining \u00bc teaspoon sugar, remaining \u215b teaspoon seasoning salt, remaining \u00bc teaspoon Dasida powder, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and sesame seeds to spinach. Lift and loosen individual pieces of spinach and mix gently until evenly coated with seasonings. Cut omelet lengthwise into quarters.\n10. Place 1 gim sheet shiny side down on bamboo mat, with longer side parallel to bottom edge of mat. Using lightly moistened hands, scoop one-quarter of seasoned rice, place rice on gim, and spread it out evenly all the way to edges. (Parts of gim should still be visible through rice; rice should not form solid layer.) Starting 1 inch from bottom edge of gim, use one-quarter of danmuji, one-quarter of carrot, and one-quarter of spinach to create three thin, adjacent rows. Use one-quarter of avocado slices and one-quarter of fish cakes to create two rows on top, followed by row of crab and row of omelet on top of avocado and fish cakes, overlapping ends if needed.\n11. Using bamboo mat as guide, lift and roll bottom edge of gim sheet up and over filling. Gently squeeze to tighten roll. Lift up top edge of mat and continue to roll remaining gim and rice into log, using mat to gently squeeze roll to seal and tighten it as you go. When fully rolled, flip bamboo mat over and roll mat away from you to release gimbap. Set gimbap aside, seam side down, and repeat shaping 3 more gimbap using remaining gim sheets, rice, and filling.\n12. Brush gimbap with remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Using sharp knife, cut each roll into \u00bd-inch-thick slices, dipping knife in water between cuts if slices begin to stick. Sprinkle with extra sesame seeds and serve.\n\nCuisine: Korean", "metadata": {"title": "Gimbap \uae40\ubc25 (Seaweed Rice Rolls)", "category": "", "cuisine": "Korean", "rating": 4.0, "ingredient_count": 19, "step_count": 12, "url": "https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/16833-seaweed-rice-rolls-gimbap"}}

Then we upgraded the \u201ccocktail\u201d with fresh takes on the dipping sauce. Shrimp cocktail should feel like luxury: plump, snappy, well-chilled meat with clean, oceanic sweetness. Nailing that profile is all about poaching the shrimp just right. Brining the shrimp seasoned them deeply, evenly, and quickly. Poaching them in the brine along with additional lightly seasoned water enhanced their flavor even more. Heating a measured amount of shrimp and water together allowed the shrimp to cook gradually so that there was little risk of overshooting the mark of 140 degrees. Calibrating the recipe so that the shrimp reached 140 degrees when the water reached 160 allowed us to monitor the temperature of the water instead of the temperature of the shrimp. For some fresh takes on the dipping sauce, we riffed on classic cocktail sauce and also mixed up a Creole R\u00e9moulade and Creamy Chermoula.\n\nIngredients:\n- 3 tablespoons, table salt, divided\n- 2 tablespoons, sugar\n- 2 pounds shell-on jumbo, shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled and deveined, tails left on\n- 8 cups, ice\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Place 1 chicken thigh skin side down on cutting board. Using sharp paring knife, trim excess skin and fat, leaving enough skin to cover meat. Cut slit along length of thigh bone to expose bone. Using tip of knife, cut/scrape meat from bone. Slip knife under bone to separate bone from meat. Discard bone and trim any remaining cartilage from thigh. Keeping thigh skin side down, cut into 1\u00bd-inch pieces, leaving as much skin attached as possible. Transfer to medium bowl and repeat with remaining thighs. Add 1\u00bd tablespoons sake and cornstarch and stir gently until chicken is evenly coated.\n2. Combine soy sauce, sugar, and remaining 2 tablespoons sake in small bowl. Microwave until sugar is dissolved, about 30 seconds. Place fine-mesh strainer over bowl containing soy sauce mixture. Add ginger to strainer and press to extract juice. Discard solids, but do not wash strainer.\n3. Line large plate with paper towels. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place chicken skin side down in skillet (skillet may be very full). Increase heat to medium-high; place Frywall or splatter screen, if using, on skillet; and cook, without moving chicken, until all pieces have \u00bc- to \u00bd-inch perimeter of white, 6 to 8 minutes. Slide skillet off heat and flip chicken. Return skillet to burner and reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook until chicken is just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes longer.\n4. Remove skillet from heat. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to prepared plate. Pour off fat, scrape any browned bits out of skillet, and wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Return chicken to skillet. Add soy sauce mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until chicken is thinly coated and sauce has consistency of maple syrup, 1 to 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to serving bowl. Pour glaze in skillet through now-empty strainer set over small serving bowl. Drizzle 2 tablespoons glaze over chicken and serve, passing remaining glaze (there will be only a few tablespoons, but it is potent) separately.\n\nCategory: Main Courses\n\nCuisine: JapaneseAsia", "metadata": {"title": "Real-Deal Chicken Teriyaki", "category": "Main Courses", "cuisine": "JapaneseAsia", "rating": 4.16, "ingredient_count": 7, "step_count": 4, "url": "https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/14218-real-deal-chicken-teriyaki"}}

You could use shop-bought pastry but nothing beats homemade\n\nIngredients:\n- about 600g cooked turkey breast meat carved into slices, brown meat chopped\n- about 600g cooked ham carved into thick slices\n- 75g butter\n- 2 leeks cleaned, halved and finely sliced\n- pinch dried thyme\n- 75g plain flour\n- splash cider vinegar\n- 200ml turkey or chicken stock\n- 250ml double cream\n- 3 tbsp wholegrain mustard\n- 1 tbsp chopped tarragon\n- 500g plain flour plus extra for dusting\n- \u00bd tsp dried sage\n- 185g cold butter cubed\n- 70g suet\n- 2 egg yolks for glazing\n\nInstructions:\n1. First, make the sauce. Heat the butter in a saucepan, add the leeks and thyme and cook very gently for 10-15 mins until soft but not coloured. Stir in the flour and cook to a sandy paste, then splash in the vinegar and bubble for a moment. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, then add the cream and simmer until you have a thick sauce. Stir through the mustard, tarragon and chopped turkey, turn off the heat and leave to cool. Set aside. Can be made a day ahead.\n2. To make the pastry, tip the flour into a food processor with the sage and 1 tsp salt. Add the butter and suet, and whizz to fine crumbs. With the motor running, slowly pour in 150ml cold water until the pastry just comes together. Tip onto a lightly floured surface and bring together into a dough. Cut just over a third of the pastry and cover while you roll out the rest to line an oiled 20cm springform tin, leaving an overhang.\n3.

Beginning with edge nearest you, roll dough into cylinder, enclosing sugar. Knead dough until sugar is evenly incorporated (a bench scraper is helpful for releasing dough from counter; if pieces of sugar pop out of dough, press them back in).\n3. Divide dough into 8 equal portions (each should weigh just over 3\u00bd ounces or 99 grams). Roll 1 portion between your hands to form 4-inch-long sausage shape. Pat into rough 4 by 2-inch oval.

As iron heats, spread remaining \u2153 cup granulated sugar in small dish. Place 1 dough portion in sugar and turn to coat on all sides. Transfer to center of waffle iron and close lid so it rests on dough but do not press down or lock. Cook until waffle is deep golden brown and surface sugar is beginning to caramelize, about 2\u00bd minutes. Using 2 forks, spear waffle on left and right sides; lift, and transfer to wire rack to cool (surface sugar will be hot; do not handle for at least 90 seconds). Repeat with remaining dough and serve.\n\nCategory: Desserts or Baked Goods", "metadata": {"title": "Li\u00e8ge Waffles", "category": "Desserts or Baked Goods", "cuisine": "", "rating": 4.35, "ingredient_count": 9, "step_count": 4, "url": "https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/15818-liege-waffles"}}

Now carry on cooking the fruit in the pan for 5 mins.\n3. Meanwhile, soak 9 sheets leaf gelatine in cold water to soften it. If you have a hand blender, blitz the cooked fruit or mash with a potato masher, then strain through a sieve into a large bowl and push through the pulp so just the skins and seeds are left. Keep the remaining liquid.\n4. Squeeze excess water from the gelatine, add to the hot fruit syrup reserved from the pulp above and stir to dissolve. Cool, then chill until on the point of almost setting.\n5. Make the custard according to pack instructions with 75g custard powder, 1.2 litres milk and 50g caster sugar to create a really thick custard. Cover the surface with baking paper while it cools a little.\n6. Pile 1\u00bd-2 cubed madeira cakes into a trifle bowl, spoon over the reserved juice and berries, then 4 tbsp sherry or cassis.\n7. Pour over a thick layer of custard, pushing it against the side of the dish to seal in the cake below. Leave to cool and set with a skin \u2013 this makes a barrier for the jelly.\n8. When the custard is cold and set, and the jelly is on the point of setting, spoon the jelly over the custard and chill until ready to complete.\n9. Whip 300-450ml double cream with 1 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tbsp icing sugar until just holding its shape, then spoon round the bowl over the set jelly. Scatter with 2 crushed amaretti biscuits and chill until ready to serve.\n\nCategory: Dessert\n\nCuisine: British", "metadata": {"title": "Classic sherry trifle", "category": "Dessert", "cuisine": "British", "ingredient_count": 11, "step_count": 9, "url": "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/classic-trifle"}}

Stir flour, yeast, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook. Add milk and eggs. Mix on low speed until dough comes together and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl and dough hook as needed. Turn off mixer, cover bowl with dish towel or plastic wrap, and let stand for 20 minutes.\n2. Add granulated sugar and salt and mix on low speed until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, a few pieces at a time. Increase speed to medium-low and continue to mix until butter is fully incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 12 minutes longer, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing.\n3. Transfer dough to lightly greased large bowl. Gather edges up and fold inward to form loose ball shape, then flip dough seam side down. Cover bowl tightly with plastic and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1\u00bd to 2 hours. (Unrisen dough can be refrigerated for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours; let sit at room temperature for 2 hours before rolling.).\n4. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease parchment. Transfer dough to floured counter and sprinkle with flour. Gently press dough to expel air, then press and roll dough to \u00bd-inch thickness (approximately 10 by 13 inches). Using 3-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut 12 rounds. (Reserve dough scraps for doughnut holes or discard.) Carefully transfer dough rounds to prepared sheet using thin metal spatula (flour spatula as needed). Cover sheet with plastic and let dough rise at room temperature until puffy, about 1 hour.\n5. About 20 minutes before end of rising time, add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 1\u00bd inches deep and heat over medium-low heat to 335 degrees. Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Using both your hands, gently drop 4 dough rounds into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Adjust heat as needed to maintain oil temperature between 330 and 340 degrees. Transfer doughnuts to prepared rack. Return oil to 335 degrees and repeat with remaining doughnuts. Let cool almost completely, about 10 minutes.\n6. Discard paper towels, leaving doughnuts on rack. Spoon jam into pastry bag or zipper-lock bag fitted with \u00bc-inch round pastry tip. Working with 1 doughnut at a time, use chopstick or skewer to poke hole through top of each doughnut, about halfway through, rotating to widen opening to about \u00bd inch.

FOR THE PORK BELLY: Using sharp chef's knife, slice pork into \u00be-inch-wide strips. Cut strips crosswise to make 16 evenly sized pieces (2 to 2\u00bd inches long). Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork in single layer (if needed, wait for some pieces to render fat and shrink before adding remainder) and cook until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping pieces halfway through cooking.\n2. Meanwhile, combine water, Shaoxing wine, hoisin, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar in bowl.\n3. Add water mixture, arbols, garlic, star anise, and ginger to pot with pork. Bring to boil over high heat, then adjust heat to maintain vigorous simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat as necessary to maintain vigorous simmer, until pork is tender and fork inserted into meat meets little resistance, about 1 hour.\n4. Off heat, use slotted spoon to transfer pork to bowl. Pour liquid into fat separator and let settle for 5 minutes; discard solids. Return defatted liquid to pot and cook over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Stir in pork, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. (Braised pork belly can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. To reheat, cook over low heat in covered Dutch oven until warmed through.).\n5. FOR THE SEASONED DAIKON: Toss daikon, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (Daikon can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.).\n6. FOR THE HOISIN-SOY SAUCE: Combine hoisin and soy sauces in small bowl.\n7. FOR THE BAO: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, sugar, yeast, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add milk and shortening and continue to mix until no dry flour remains and dough has formed ball around hook, about 2 minutes longer. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 minutes.\n8. Transfer dough to counter and knead briefly to form smooth ball. Grease medium bowl with \u00bc teaspoon oil. Place dough in bowl and roll in oil to coat. Arrange dough in bowl seam side down and cover. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\n9. While dough rises, cut sixteen 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Divide squares evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets (8 squares per sheet). Place remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small bowl.\n10. Transfer dough to counter. Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Knead briefly to form smooth ball. Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut dough in half. Return half of dough to bowl and cover.\n11. Roll remaining dough into 8-inch log. Cut log into 8 equal portions (about 1\u2153 ounces each) and cover. Using your fingertips, pat 1 portion to \u00bc-inch-thick disk (keep remaining portions covered). Fold edges toward center and pinch to form ball. Turn ball pinched side down and round to form smooth sphere. Cover and repeat with remaining 7 portions.\n12. Roll 1 dough ball into 6-inch oval. Transfer to small cutting board or plate and brush lightly with oil. Lightly brush chopstick with oil and lay it horizontally across center of oval. Fold oval in half over chopstick to form bun. Using chopstick, lift dough (it should drape evenly over both sides) and transfer to parchment square. Gently pull out chopstick, leaving bun folded. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Cover buns and let rise until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes. Repeat steps 11 and 12 with remaining dough, placing buns on second prepared sheet.\n13. Meanwhile, bring 4 cups water to boil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch skillet. Arrange first batch of buns, on parchment squares, in two 10-inch bamboo steamer baskets (4 buns per basket). Stack baskets and cover. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and set steamer in wok. Steam buns for 10 minutes (do not uncover, as buns might collapse; small wisps of steam should escape from beneath lid during cooking). Off heat, remove steamer from wok and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer buns, still on parchment, to wire rack. Steam remaining buns.\n14. To serve, place slice of pork inside bun. Garnish with seasoned daikon; hoisin-soy sauce; cilantro; scallions; peanuts; and Thai chiles, if using. Serve immediately.\n15. STORAGE AND REHEATING: Bao can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 3 hours or refrigerated for up to 3 days. To serve, resteam (on parchment squares) for 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, bao can be frozen for up to 1 month. Arrange cooled bao (on parchment squares) in zipper-lock bag.

Cook for 30-40 minutes, partially cover, and stir every once in a while. If it starts to look dry, add some of the sauce from the carton, slowly , as you need it. Add the salt and pepper - I like a lot because I love salt on tomatoes.\n6. The final product should be a thick sauce that just looks like a whole lot of tomatoes stuck together - with very little to no juice, that is about 1-1 1/2 inches high.\n7. Crack open the eggs on top of the shakshuka, one by one, giving each their own space. The whites should overlap, but the yolk should be spaced about 4 fingerwidths from each other. My pan can fit 6-8 eggs very comfortably.\n8.
