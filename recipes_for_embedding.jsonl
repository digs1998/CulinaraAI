FOR THE PORK BELLY: Using sharp chef's knife, slice pork into \u00be-inch-wide strips. Cut strips crosswise to make 16 evenly sized pieces (2 to 2\u00bd inches long). Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork in single layer (if needed, wait for some pieces to render fat and shrink before adding remainder) and cook until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping pieces halfway through cooking.\n2. Meanwhile, combine water, Shaoxing wine, hoisin, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar in bowl.\n3. Add water mixture, arbols, garlic, star anise, and ginger to pot with pork. Bring to boil over high heat, then adjust heat to maintain vigorous simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat as necessary to maintain vigorous simmer, until pork is tender and fork inserted into meat meets little resistance, about 1 hour.\n4. Off heat, use slotted spoon to transfer pork to bowl. Pour liquid into fat separator and let settle for 5 minutes; discard solids. Return defatted liquid to pot and cook over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Stir in pork, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. (Braised pork belly can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. To reheat, cook over low heat in covered Dutch oven until warmed through.).\n5. FOR THE SEASONED DAIKON: Toss daikon, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (Daikon can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.).\n6. FOR THE HOISIN-SOY SAUCE: Combine hoisin and soy sauces in small bowl.\n7. FOR THE BAO: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, sugar, yeast, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add milk and shortening and continue to mix until no dry flour remains and dough has formed ball around hook, about 2 minutes longer. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 minutes.\n8. Transfer dough to counter and knead briefly to form smooth ball. Grease medium bowl with \u00bc teaspoon oil. Place dough in bowl and roll in oil to coat. Arrange dough in bowl seam side down and cover. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\n9. While dough rises, cut sixteen 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Divide squares evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets (8 squares per sheet). Place remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small bowl.\n10. Transfer dough to counter. Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Knead briefly to form smooth ball. Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut dough in half. Return half of dough to bowl and cover.\n11. Roll remaining dough into 8-inch log. Cut log into 8 equal portions (about 1\u2153 ounces each) and cover. Using your fingertips, pat 1 portion to \u00bc-inch-thick disk (keep remaining portions covered). Fold edges toward center and pinch to form ball. Turn ball pinched side down and round to form smooth sphere. Cover and repeat with remaining 7 portions.\n12. Roll 1 dough ball into 6-inch oval. Transfer to small cutting board or plate and brush lightly with oil. Lightly brush chopstick with oil and lay it horizontally across center of oval. Fold oval in half over chopstick to form bun. Using chopstick, lift dough (it should drape evenly over both sides) and transfer to parchment square. Gently pull out chopstick, leaving bun folded. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Cover buns and let rise until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes. Repeat steps 11 and 12 with remaining dough, placing buns on second prepared sheet.\n13. Meanwhile, bring 4 cups water to boil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch skillet. Arrange first batch of buns, on parchment squares, in two 10-inch bamboo steamer baskets (4 buns per basket). Stack baskets and cover. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and set steamer in wok. Steam buns for 10 minutes (do not uncover, as buns might collapse; small wisps of steam should escape from beneath lid during cooking). Off heat, remove steamer from wok and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer buns, still on parchment, to wire rack. Steam remaining buns.\n14. To serve, place slice of pork inside bun. Garnish with seasoned daikon; hoisin-soy sauce; cilantro; scallions; peanuts; and Thai chiles, if using. Serve immediately.\n15. STORAGE AND REHEATING: Bao can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 3 hours or refrigerated for up to 3 days. To serve, resteam (on parchment squares) for 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, bao can be frozen for up to 1 month. Arrange cooled bao (on parchment squares) in zipper-lock bag.

For the dough: Spray inside bottom and sides of large bowl with vegetable oil spray and set aside. In liquid measuring cup, combine water and 1 tablespoon oil.\n2. Add flour, yeast, and sugar to food processor and lock lid into place. Hold down pulse button for 1 second, then release. Repeat until ingredients are combined, about five 1-second pulses.\n3. Turn on processor, then slowly pour water mixture through feed tube and process until dough comes together, about 30 seconds. Stop processor. Let dough sit for 10 minutes.\n4. Remove processor lid and sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt over dough. Lock lid back into place. Turn on processor and process for 1 minute. Stop processor.\n5. Remove lid and carefully remove processor blade (ask an adult for help). Lightly spray counter and your hands with vegetable oil spray. Transfer dough to greased counter and use your greased hands to knead dough for 30 seconds, then form dough into smooth ball (see photos, \u201cStep-by-Step: How to Knead Dough\u201d).\n6. Place dough in greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise until bubbly and doubled in size, 1 to 1\u00bd hours.\n7. For the pizzas: When dough is ready, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Spray 2 rimmed baking sheets well with vegetable oil spray.\n8. Place room-temperature dough on clean counter. Use bench scraper or chef\u2019s knife to divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Pat each piece of dough into 3\u00bd-\u00adinch circle.\n9. Spray piece of plastic wrap lightly with vegetable oil spray. Cover dough pieces with greased plastic. Let rise on counter until slightly puffy, about 15 minutes.\n10. While dough rises, set colander in sink. Pour tomatoes in colander. Shake colander to drain tomatoes well.\n11. Transfer drained tomatoes to clean food processor. Add garlic, vinegar, oregano, pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and \u00bc teaspoon salt. Lock lid into place. Turn on processor and process mixture until smooth, about 30 seconds. Stop processor.\n12. Remove lid and carefully remove processor blade. Use rubber spatula to transfer sauce to medium bowl. Measure out \u00bd cup sauce. (Remaining sauce can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days.).\n13. Sprinkle clean counter lightly with flour. Remove one piece of dough from under plastic and place on lightly floured counter. Flip dough over to coat with flour. Use rolling pin to roll into 7-\u00adinch circle, rotating dough in between rolls (see photos, \u201cStep-by-Step: How to Roll Personal Pizzas\u201d).\n14. Transfer rolled dough to one greased baking sheet. Repeat rolling with one more piece of dough and place on same baking sheet.\n15. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce into center of each pizza and use back of spoon to spread into even layer, leaving \u00bc-\u00adinch border around edge.\n16. Sprinkle each pizza with \u00bc cup mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Top with your favorite toppings (see \u201cMake It Your Way\u201d).\n17. Place baking sheet in oven and bake pizzas until edges are browned and cheeses are well browned and bubbling, 10 to 12 minutes.\n18. While first 2 pizzas are baking, shape and top 2 more pizzas, repeating steps 10 through 13 with remaining 2 dough balls, sauce, cheeses, and toppings. Place pizzas on second greased baking sheet.\n19. Use oven mitts to remove first baking sheet from oven and place on cooling rack (ask an adult for help). Let pizzas cool for 5 minutes.

FOR THE APPLES: Combine apples and sugar in Dutch oven. Cook, covered, over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until all apples are slightly softened and about half are just becoming translucent, 8 to 14 minutes (it's OK if a few pieces break). Transfer apples and juices to rimmed baking sheet set on wire rack. Spread apples into even layer and let cool, about 30 minutes. While apples are cooling, prepare crust.\n2. FOR THE CRUST: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in bowl and rub together with your fingers to combine and to break up any lumps of sugar. Set aside 1 tablespoon egg for egg wash. Add remaining egg, melted butter, and water to flour mixture and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to counter (do not wash bowl) and knead until dough is smooth and uniform. Shape into 9-inch cylinder and cut crosswise into 3 equal portions.\n3. Place 1 portion of dough on 16 by 12-inch sheet of parchment and press into 8 by 4-inch rectangle. Cover with second piece of parchment and roll into rough 12 by 10-inch rectangle. Transfer to second rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate. Crumble second portion of dough into bottom of 9-inch springform pan. Press to cover bottom of pan. Break off 1-inch chunks of remaining portion of dough and press into sides of pan. Refrigerate.\n4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Using your hands or slotted spoon, transfer apples to now-empty bowl, leaving any juices on sheet. Add raisins, if using; cornstarch; lemon juice; cinnamon; ginger; cardamom; coriander; nutmeg; and salt and stir until combined. Transfer to dough-lined pan. Spread evenly and press gently to compact. Smooth top.\n5. Transfer rolled dough, still in parchment, to counter, with long side parallel to edge of counter. Peel parchment from dough and return parchment to baking sheet. Using ruler and sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough lengthwise into eight 1\u00bc-inch-wide strips. Using offset spatula to lift dough, place 4 strips equidistant from each other on top of pie (if strips differ in length, place longer strips in middle and shorter strips at sides), letting sides of strips hang over edge of pan. Place remaining 4 strips on top, arranging them at 45-degree angle to first set of strips. Gently press strips down so they rest against filling (it's OK if ends of some strips crack). Trim ends of strips so they are flush with pan edge. Place pie on prepared sheet. (Pie can be wrapped and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.).\n6. Brush top of pie with reserved egg. Bake for 45 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and continue to bake until skewer can be easily inserted into apples, about 30 minutes longer. Transfer pan to wire rack. Run paring knife around top edge of pie. Carefully release clip and remove ring. Let cool completely, at least 4 hours. Using sharp knife in gentle sawing motion to prevent top crust from crumbling, cut into wedges.

For the cookies: In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In small bowl, whisk together egg and vanilla.\n2. Add sugar to food processor and lock lid into place. Turn on processor and process until sugar is finely ground, about 30 seconds.\n3. Stop processor and remove lid. Add chilled butter to processor and lock lid back into place. Turn on processor and process until smooth, about 30 seconds.\n4. Stop processor and remove lid. Add egg mixture and flour mixture and lock lid back into place. Turn on processor and process until no dry flour is visible and mixture forms crumbly dough, about 30 seconds.\n5. Stop processor, remove lid, and carefully remove processor blade (ask an adult for help). Use rubber spatula to transfer dough to center of large sheet of parchment paper on counter.\n6. Use your hands to pat dough into 7-by-9-inch oval. Place second large sheet of parchment on top of dough. Use rolling pin to roll dough into 10-by-14-inch oval (\u215b to \u00bc inch thick), rolling dough between parchment.\n7. Slide dough (still between parchment) onto 1 baking sheet. Place baking sheet in refrigerator and refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1\u00bd hours.\n8. While dough is chilling, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line second baking sheet with parchment.\n9. When dough is ready, remove dough from refrigerator. Gently peel off top sheet of parchment. Use cookie cutters to cut dough into shapes. (After cutting out your cookie shapes, put all the leftover dough scraps together, reroll the dough between sheets of parchment paper to \u215b- to \u00bc-inch thickness, and cut out more shapes. It\u2019s best to do this only one time\u2014if you reroll this dough more than once, the cookies will turn out tough.).\n10.

Bring water and milk to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Stir in macaroni and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, until macaroni is soft (slightly past al dente), 6 to 8 minutes. Add American cheese, mustard, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in Gruy\u00e8re and blue cheese until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan and let stand for 5 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, combine panko, oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in 8-inch nonstick skillet until panko is evenly moistened.

For the Meringue: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Using pencil, draw 10-inch circle in center of 18 by 13-inch piece of parchment paper.\n2. Combine sugar and egg whites in bowl of stand mixer; place bowl over saucepan filled with 1 inch simmering water, making sure that water does not touch bottom of bowl. Whisking gently but constantly, heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture registers 160 to 165 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes.\n3. Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and whip mixture on high speed until meringue forms stiff peaks, is smooth and creamy, and is bright white with sheen, about 4 minutes (bowl may still be slightly warm to touch). Stop mixer and scrape down bowl with spatula. Add vinegar, cornstarch, and vanilla and whip on high speed until combined, about 10 seconds.\n4. Spoon about \u00bc teaspoon meringue onto each corner of rimmed baking sheet. Press parchment, marked side down, onto sheet to secure. Pile meringue in center of circle on parchment. Using circle as guide, spread and smooth meringue with back of spoon or spatula from center outward, building 10-inch disk that is slightly higher around edges.

It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1/2 of the sauce from this recipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later! Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review. I read and appreciate every one of them! Chef Note: After I posted this recipe I remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss. Goes to show you--don't use a wine for cooking you wouldn't drink. You get the best results from a good wine!\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 lbs Italian sausage, casings removed (mild or hot)\n- 1 small onion, chopped (optional)\n- 3 -4 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes\n- 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste\n- 2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce\n- 2 cups water (for a long period of simmering for flavors to meld.

In large, heavy stockpot, brown Italian sausage, breaking up as you stir.\n2. Add onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until onions are softened.\n3. Add garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce and water.\n4. Add basil, parsley, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper.\n5. Stir well and barely bring to a boil.\n6. Stir in red wine.\n7. Simmer on low, stirring frequently for at least an hour. A longer simmer makes for a better sauce, just be careful not to let it burn!.\n8.

Remove roast and ribs from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature 2 hours. After an hour, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Rub oxtails with tomato paste and place in heavy-bottomed, burner-safe roasting pan. Toss onions with 1 tablespoon oil, then scatter onions in roasting pan. Roast until oxtails and onions are browned, about 45 minutes, flipping oxtails halfway through cooking time. Remove from oven and set roasting pan with oxtails aside; reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees.\n2. When roast has stood at room temperature 2 hours, heat heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over medium heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, rub ends and fat-side of roast with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, then sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (or 3/4 teaspoon table salt) and pepper. Place roast fat-side down in skillet and cook until well-browned, 12 to 15 minutes; using tongs, stand roast on end and cook until well-browned, about 4 minutes. Repeat with other end. Do not brown side where ribs were attached. Place roast browned-side up on cutting board and cool 10 minutes. Following illustration 1 below, tie browned roast to ribs. Set roast bone-side down in roasting pan (see illustration 2), pushing oxtails and onions to sides of pan. Roast 1 hour, then remove from oven and check internal temperature; center of roast should register about 70 degrees on instant-read thermometer. (If internal temperature is higher or lower, adjust total cooking time.) Return roast to oven, and prepare Yorkshire pudding batter now (if making), and cook 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 hours longer, until center of meat registers about 122 degrees for rare to medium-rare or about 130 degrees for medium-rare to medium (see illustration 3) . Transfer roast to cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees for Yorkshire pudding.\n3. While roast rests, spoon off fat from roasting pan, reserving 3 tablespoons for Yorkshire puddings; set roasting pan aside while preparing puddings for baking. While puddings bake, set roasting pan over 2 burners at high heat. Add wine to roasting pan; using wooden spoon, scrape up browned bits and boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add beef broth, chicken broth, and thyme. Cut twine on roast and remove meat from ribs; re-tent meat. Add ribs, meaty side down, to roasting pan and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by two-thirds (to about 2 cups), 16 to 20 minutes. Add any accumulated beef juices from meat and cook to heat through, about 1 minute longer. Discard ribs and oxtails; strain jus through mesh strainer into gravy boat, pressing on onions to extract as much liquid as possible.\n4.

Ours is as foolproof as it is beautiful.\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 1/2 cups (10\u00bd ounces/298 grams) sugar\n- 3/4 cup (6 ounces) egg whites (5 to 7 large eggs)\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 2 pounds (907 grams) strawberries , hulled and quartered (5 cups)\n- 1 tablespoon sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest plus 1\u00bd teaspoons juice\n- Pinch salt\n- 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil , plus 10 small leaves, divided\n- 2 cups heavy cream , chilled\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\n\nInstructions:\n1. For the Meringue: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Using pencil, draw 10-inch circle in center of 18 by 13-inch piece of parchment paper.\n2. Combine sugar and egg whites in bowl of stand mixer; place bowl over saucepan filled with 1 inch simmering water, making sure that water does not touch bottom of bowl. Whisking gently but constantly, heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture registers 160 to 165 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes.\n3. Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and whip mixture on high speed until meringue forms stiff peaks, is smooth and creamy, and is bright white with sheen, about 4 minutes (bowl may still be slightly warm to touch). Stop mixer and scrape down bowl with spatula. Add vinegar, cornstarch, and vanilla and whip on high speed until combined, about 10 seconds.\n4. Spoon about \u00bc teaspoon meringue onto each corner of rimmed baking sheet. Press parchment, marked side down, onto sheet to secure. Pile meringue in center of circle on parchment. Using circle as guide, spread and smooth meringue with back of spoon or spatula from center outward, building 10-inch disk that is slightly higher around edges. Finished disk should measure about 1 inch high with \u00bc-inch depression in center.\n5. Bake meringue until exterior is dry and crisp and meringue releases cleanly from parchment when gently lifted at edge with thin metal spatula, 1 to 1\u00bd hours. Meringue should be quite pale (a hint of creamy color is OK). Turn off oven, prop door open with wooden spoon, and let meringue cool in oven for 1\u00bd hours. Remove from oven and let cool completely before topping, about 15 minutes. (Cooled meringue can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 1 week.).\n6. For the Topping: Toss strawberries with sugar, lime zest and juice, and salt in large bowl. Set aside for 30 minutes.\n7. For the Whipped Cream: Before serving, stir chopped basil into strawberry mixture. Whip cream and sugar in chilled bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment on low speed until small bubbles form, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and whip until whisk leaves trail, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and continue to whip until cream is smooth, thick, and nearly doubled in volume, about 20 seconds longer for soft peaks. If necessary, finish whipping by hand to adjust consistency.\n8. Carefully peel meringue away from parchment and place on large serving platter. Spoon whipped cream into center of meringue. Using slotted spoon, spoon topping in even layer over whipped cream. Garnish with basil leaves. Let stand for at least 5 minutes or up to 1 hour.

{"id": "recipe_391", "text": "Recipe: Best Ever Banana Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\n\nDescription: This is one of (if not) the BEST banana cake I have ever tasted! I thought the oven temp of 275\u00b0 sounded a little low, but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. I do not know if the little \"freezer trick\" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but I did it, and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. Would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and I got exceptional results. So moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o) Depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it. I was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over again!! So glad I came across this one!! (on another website). (* * Just to update the recipe, (based on some of the reviews), the baking time may vary based on individual ovens. It was RIGHT ON for my oven, but some others have stated it has taken 1 hour 10 minutes, 1 hour 20 minutes, and my sister just informed me that it took 1 hour 30 minutes in her oven!!!!!)\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 1/2 cups bananas, mashed, ripe\n- 2 teaspoons lemon juice\n- 3 cups flour\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda\n- 1/4 teaspoon salt\n- 3/4 cup butter, softened\n- 2 1/8 cups sugar\n- 3 large eggs\n- 2 teaspoons vanilla\n- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk\n- 1/2 cup butter, softened\n- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla\n- 3 1/2 cups icing sugar\n- chopped walnuts\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine garlic and anchovies in small bowl; press with back of fork to form paste. Stir in tomato paste and set mixture aside.\n2. Pat meat dry with paper towels. Do not season. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of beef and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total, reducing heat if oil begins to smoke or fond begins to burn. Transfer beef to large plate. Repeat with remaining beef and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, leaving second batch of meat in pot after browning.\n3. Reduce heat to medium and return first batch of beef to pot. Add onion and carrots to Dutch oven and stir to combine with beef. Cook, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any browned bits, until onion is softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds.\n4. Slowly add wine, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any browned bits. Increase heat to high and allow wine to simmer until thickened and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth, bay leaves, thyme, and salt pork. Bring to simmer, cover, transfer to oven, and cook for 1 1/2 hours.\n5. Remove pot from oven; remove and discard bay leaves and salt pork. Stir in potatoes, cover, return to oven, and cook until potatoes are almost tender, about 45 minutes.\n6. Using large spoon, skim any excess fat from surface of stew. Stir in pearl onions; cook over medium heat until potatoes and onions are cooked through and meat offers little resistance when poked with fork (meat should not be falling apart), about 15 minutes.
